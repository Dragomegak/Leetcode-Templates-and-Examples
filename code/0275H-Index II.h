/*
Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, 
write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, 
and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
    int n=citations.size();
    if(n==0 || citations[n-1]==0) return 0;
    int left=0,right=n,mid;
    while(left<right){
        mid=left+(right-left)/2;
        if(citations[mid]>=(n-mid))
            right=mid;
        else
            left=mid+1;
    }
    return n-left;
}
